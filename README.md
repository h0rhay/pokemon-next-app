# Next JS Pokemon Explorer

Architecture:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Spec:
- Build an App using NextJS and using the [Pokemon API endpoint](https://pokeapi.co/) for content.
- The application will fetch data, render it, and provide various filtering and pagination capabilities.
- On the wallet page the application integrates web3 functionality to allow users to connect their wallets
- Test coverage
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load PokemonFont, a local font that matches the Pokemon look and feel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
